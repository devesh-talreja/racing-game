# Duel Racer

![Duel Racer Gameplay](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Beta-brightgreen.svg)

**Duel Racer** is an intensely fast-paced, top-down 1v1 racing game completely built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Challenge a brutally adaptive computer driver across 10 radically distinct, mathematically generated track geometries. 

Master the momentum-based drifting physics, razor-thin braking zones, and perfect your racing lines to shave off milliseconds.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Custom Physics Engine**: Real-time momentum, solid restitution bounding walls, off-track friction penalties, and drifting mechanics.
* **Algorithmic NPC Competitor**: The computer driver mathematically scales with your speed, dynamically throttles for tight hairpins, makes probabilistic mistakes under pressure, and actively pursues the flawless racing line.
* **Local Persistence**: Integrated database automatically saves your unlocked levels, fastest lap times, and customizable keyboard sensitivities.
* **Controller/Keyboard Support**: Full `WASD` / `Arrow Key` bindings for both racing and navigating the fluid, animated UI menus.

* **Level 3** - Night Road *(Sweeping Figure-Eight)*
* **Level 4** - Diamond Circuit *(45-Degree Rigid Square)*
* **Level 5** - Clover Circuit *(3-Leaf Parametric Curve)*
* **Level 6** - Neon Cross *(Massive Hollow 4-Leaf Star)*
* **Level 7** - Twin Void *(Pinched "Peanut" Hourglass)*
* **Level 8** - Binary Orbit *(High-Velocity Pinched Oval)*
* **Level 9** - Velocity Box *(Brutal 60px Hairpins on a long box)*
* **Level 10** - Nebula Star *(Technical 5-Leaf Sweeping Core)*

## 🛠️ How to Play Locally

Duel Racer relies entirely on client-side browser technology and does not require a backend node server to compile. 

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devesh-talreja/duel-racer.git
   ```
2. **Run the Game:**
   * **Option A**: Simply double-click on `index.html` to open the game natively in your default web browser! No installation required.
   * **Option B**: If you prefer, run a local testing server in your terminal:
     ```bash
     npx serve .
     ```
     Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎮 Controls

* **W / Up Arrow**: Accelerate
* **S / Down Arrow**: Brake / Reverse
* **A / Left Arrow**: Steer Left
* **D / Right Arrow**: Steer Right
* **P / Esc**: Pause / Resume Race
* **Enter**: Select UI Options

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

Duel Racer is actively evolving! Planned future updates include:
* **Grand Prix Tier (Levels 11-20)**: Complex, asymmetrical street circuits and brutal choke points.
* **Car Progression Mechanics**: Unlock the later cars natively by defeating certain NPC bosses.
* **Visual Polish**: Dynamic particle effects (tire smoke, grass dust) and animated crowd elements.
* **Mini-Map HUD**: A transparent 2D overlay to track you and the AI globally.
* **Continuous Engine Fixes**: Ongoing optimizations for Keyboard/UI Focus retention during pause toggling and input cleanup.
